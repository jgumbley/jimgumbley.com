Summary: We're not 6 months from AGI; we're 6 months from confronting the security implications of AI systems with real-world agency.

We're not 6 months from AGI. We're 6 months from an inflection point where LLMs are being given real-world agency – with all the security and governance implications that entails. Different ways of describing the same phenomena, one grounded in Silicon Valley marketing, the other in operational reality.

The organizational controls and governance frameworks created in response will significantly shape the trajectory of AI development.

## Beyond Theoretical Debates

While theoretical debates about AGI timelines continue, a more immediate security concern is emerging: organizations are rapidly deploying LLMs with actual agency in production environments. The focus on capabilities and benchmarks misses the governance reality—systems are being granted permissions to act in ways that create novel attack surfaces and risk vectors.

## The Implementation Gap

This rollout reveals concerning patterns across sectors:
* Reduced human oversight in critical decision pathways
* Deployment in environments with complex threat models
* Access provisioning to sensitive infrastructure and data
* AI systems integrated with financial transaction or health capabilities

The consequences won't be confined to research labs—they'll manifest in security incidents, compliance challenges, and operational disruptions that demand immediate responses.

## Establishing Governance Frameworks

The institutional responses to these inevitable security incidents will establish lasting governance patterns. In short risk management frameworks will need to recalibrated for autonomous systems

These governance structures—developed under operational pressure—will likely define the security boundaries of AI development more definitively than any capability roadmap.

The coming months aren't about theoretical intelligence thresholds—they're about what happens when AI systems act with increasing autonomy in consequential domains without mature security models. The organizations that approach this transition with rigorous risk assessment methodologies will be best positioned to both innovate and maintain operational integrity.

The real question isn't when we reach artificial general intelligence. It's how effectively we can adapt our security governance to manage the operational, compliance, and risk implications of increasingly autonomous systems acting in our digital infrastructure.
