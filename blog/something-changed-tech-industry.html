  <h2>Something changed in the Tech Industry</h2>
  <div class="post-info">Mon 09 September 2024</div>
  <h2>It's all just plugging Legos now</h2>
<p>The tech industry has experienced a significant shift towards cloud computing and the integration of prepackaged services. This change has fundamentally altered the landscape of software development, moving away from custom builds towards a model of "gluing together" existing components. The era of building everything from scratch is giving way to a more efficient, modular approach that leverages pre-existing cloud infrastructure and services.</p>
<h2>The changing role of developers</h2>
<p>This shift has profoundly impacted the role of developers and engineers in tech companies. Increasingly, tech professionals find themselves following pre-set playbooks rather than crafting entirely novel solutions. The scope for innovative new programming languages and approaches has diminished as work is now often conducted at a higher level of abstraction. This change represents a significant departure from the traditional software development paradigm, emphasizing integration and configuration over ground-up creation.</p>
<h2>Evolution of skills and knowledge</h2>
<p>The skills and knowledge required for tech professionals have evolved in tandem with these industry changes. Cloud certifications have become increasingly important, reflecting the need for expertise in specific cloud platforms and services. This shift highlights a move towards more specialized, platform-specific knowledge rather than broader, language-centric programming skills. As a result, tech professionals must continually adapt and update their skillsets to remain relevant in this cloud-dominated landscape.</p>
<h2>The new competitive landscape</h2>
<p>The competitive landscape in the tech industry has been reshaped by this shift. While many companies have benefited from the move to cloud and prepackaged services, it has also led to a certain commoditization of tech services. Success now often favors those who can execute in the most consistent and efficient manner, rather than necessarily those with the most innovative ideas or the best raw talent. This change has leveled the playing field in some ways, but it also poses challenges for companies trying to differentiate themselves in an increasingly homogenized tech ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, while cloud adoption has reached a saturation point, its influence will remain strong. The introduction of generative AI is poised to further enhance the ability to integrate and "bolt together" various components, akin to the impact Visual Basic for Applications had in its time. While this trend may cover a significant portion of the industry's needs, there will still be opportunities for novel, custom software development, albeit potentially less frequently. The challenge for the industry will be balancing the efficiency and speed offered by these pre-packaged solutions with the need for innovation and customization that drives technological progress.</p>
